IMDB project has the dataset where few questions are solved using different excel functions 

I recently worked on an exciting IMDB project, leveraging Excel to dive into key movie data and extract valuable insights. The dataset I was working with included columns like Series_Title, Released_Year, Certificate, Runtime, Genre, IMDB_Rating, Meta_score, Director, No_of_Votes, Gross, and ID. My goal was to answer specific questions related to movie ratings, votes, and certificates.

One of the tasks involved filtering movies with a UA certificate, which was easily achieved using Excel's FILTER function to sift through the dataset. For another question, I calculated the total IMDB rating for movies with an "A" certificate. This required the SUMIF function to conditionally sum ratings based on the certificate type.

I also needed to count the number of votes for UA certificate movies, and Excel's COUNTIF function came in handy for this. Similarly, to find the total gross for all movies in the dataset, I used the SUM function, which allowed me to quickly calculate the combined gross earnings.

The next challenge involved counting the data where the meta score was greater than 80. Here, I applied the COUNTIF function again, setting the condition to filter scores above the 80 mark.

For a more targeted query, I was asked to show the genre for the movie with ID 18. Using VLOOKUP, I easily retrieved the genre based on this specific ID.

Lastly, I worked with conditional logic to classify movies based on their certificates. If a movie had an "A" certificate, I displayed "Adult," for "UA" it showed "Under Age," and for other certificates, I marked them as "Kids." The SWITCH function was my tool of choice here, as it allowed me to create clear and organized categories based on the certificate type.

This project not only sharpened my data analysis skills but also gave me more hands-on experience in using Excel's powerful functions to extract insights from real-world datasets. Working through these various tasks reaffirmed the value of Excel in handling diverse data challenges, and Iâ€™m eager to apply these learnings in future projects!
